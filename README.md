## History of Python

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He began implementing Python in December 1989 as a hobby project to keep himself occupied during the Christmas holidays. The language was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, aiming to address its shortcomings while retaining its strengths.

The first official release, Python 0.9.0, occurred in February 1991. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing new features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released, which was not backward compatible with Python 2.

Guido van Rossum led the development of Python until July 2018, when he stepped down from his role as the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL).
