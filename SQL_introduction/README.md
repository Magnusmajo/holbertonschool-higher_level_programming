# SQL - Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data within a database. SQL is essential for database management and is widely used in various applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems. Key features of SQL include its ability to handle complex queries, join multiple tables, and ensure data integrity through constraints and transactions.

## Tasks

### 0. List databases

Write a script that lists all databases of your MySQL server.

### 1. Create a database

Write a script that creates the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- If the database `hbtn_0c_0` already exists, your script should not fail.
- You are not allowed to use the `SELECT` or `SHOW` statements.

### 2. Delete a database

Write a script that deletes the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- If the database `hbtn_0c_0` doesn’t exist, your script should not fail.
- You are not allowed to use the `SELECT` or `SHOW` statements.

### 3. List tables

Write a script that lists all the tables of a database in your MySQL server.

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 4. First table

Write a script that creates a table called `first_table` in the current database in your MySQL server.

`first_table` description:
- `id INT`
- `name VARCHAR(256)`

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.
- If the table `first_table` already exists, your script should not fail.
- You are not allowed to use the `SELECT` or `SHOW` statements.

### 5. Full description

Write a script that prints the description of the table `first_table` from the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.
- You are not allowed to use the `DESCRIBE` or `EXPLAIN` statements.

### 6. List all in table

Write a script that lists all rows of the table `first_table` from the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- All fields should be printed.
- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 7. First add

Write a script that inserts a new row in the table `first_table` (database `hbtn_0c_0`) in your MySQL server.

New row:
- `id = 89`
- `name = Best School`

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 8. Count 89

Write a script that displays the number of records with `id = 89` in the table `first_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 9. Full creation

Write a script that creates a table `second_table` in the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server and adds multiple rows.

`second_table` description:
- `id INT`
- `name VARCHAR(256)`
- `score INT`

- The database name will be passed as an argument to the `mysql` command.
- If the table `second_table` already exists, your script should not fail.
- You are not allowed to use the `SELECT` and `SHOW` statements.
- Your script should create these records:
    - `id = 1, name = “John”, score = 10`
    - `id = 2, name = “Alex”, score = 3`
    - `id = 3, name = “Bob”, score = 14`
    - `id = 4, name = “George”, score = 8`

### 10. List by best

Write a script that lists all records of the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- Results should display both the `score` and the `name` (in this order).
- Records should be ordered by `score` (top first).
- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 11. Select the best

Write a script that lists all records with a `score >= 10` in the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- Results should display both the `score` and the `name` (in this order).
- Records should be ordered by `score` (top first).
- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 12. Cheating is bad

Write a script that updates the score of Bob to 10 in the table `second_table`.

- You are not allowed to use Bob’s `id` value, only the `name` field.
- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 13. Score too low

Write a script that removes all records with a `score <= 5` in the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 14. Average

Write a script that computes the score average of all records in the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- The result column name should be `average`.
- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command.

### 15. Number by score

Write a script that lists the number of records with the same score in the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- The result should display:
    - the `score`
    - the number of records for this score with the label `number`
- The list should be sorted by the number of records (descending).
- The database name will be passed as an argument to the `mysql` command.

### 16. Say my name

Write a script that lists all records of the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

- Don’t list rows without a `name` value.
- Results should display the `score` and the `name` (in this order).
- Records should be listed by descending `score`.
- The database name will be passed as an argument to the `mysql` command.
