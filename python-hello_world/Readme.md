You can find the source code here: https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/de5f019a6c7aa1758fdbd89491ca2ed2b297ff42/5-print_string.py

The output of the program should be:
3 times the value of str
followed by a new line
followed by the 9 first characters of str
followed by a new line
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
Your program should be maximum 5 lines long
