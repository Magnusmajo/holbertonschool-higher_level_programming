# Why indentation is so important in Python

Indentation is essential in Python as it forms a core part of its syntax, defining the program's structure and flow. Unlike languages that use braces or keywords to mark code blocks, Python relies on whitespace. This means the way you indent your code determines how instructions are grouped, such as in functions, loops, or conditional statements.

Improper indentation can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behaviors during execution. Since indentation is mandatory in Python, maintaining proper indentation not only ensures code correctness but also improves readability, collaboration, and maintainability by providing a clear and consistent structure.
