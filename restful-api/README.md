# Restfull API
## API Summary

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. Key principles include:

- **Stateless**: Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server**: The client and server are separate entities, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
- **Uniform Interface**: Simplifies and decouples the architecture, enabling each part to evolve independently.
- **Layered System**: The client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way.

RESTful APIs are widely used due to their simplicity and scalability.
